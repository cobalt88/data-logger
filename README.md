How to capture all your logs in a file instead of in your console. 

If you have needed a way to write your console logs to a file instead of to the console, or if you have ever wanted to capture an API response in a file, than this repository has everything you need.

In all reality the only thing you need from this code base to make it work is the logger.js file. Everything else is just there to show how it can be used. 

The short of it is you use the build fs and Console modules to save your console.log's to a file. And there are a few ways of doing this.
